### Hi there, I'm Francisco ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on building my own CSS library so I won't rely too much on other CSS libraries.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Laravel Livewire, a full-stack framework for Laravel that takes the pain out of building dynamic UIs.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on working a small project, profit or non-profit.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with mentoring me. I don't know what technologies that are best to learn that will still be good in the future.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can message my Facebook page at facebook.com/zenabus.dev or my Instagram account at instagram.com/zenabus.dev.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm lazy.
